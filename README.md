👋 Hello there, I’m Vasiliy Emelin, UX/UI Designer.

More than 10 years of huge experience in UX/UI Design with a strong portfolio and strong skills in user interface design, interaction design, visual design, usability, UX research, AB testing, wireframing, and prototyping. Regular collaboration with product and engineering teams to provide and deliver high-quality user experiences through the design of the customer-facing web application and user interface.

I'm always embracing constructive criticism as part of the design process and can clearly articulate your design decisions. My priority is to solve business goals and understand users' needs. I can perform well-defined tasks with full independence and increasing pace. I'm engaged with the processing to get inputs or feedback from the clients as real users during communications with them and making decisions with the UX research.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on UX/UI Design, Micro Interaction, Animation, React JS, JavaScript, HTML, CSS/SCSS
